### Setup Configuration

Used to setup my linux machines with my ideal coding and DevOps software.

Copy the script the bare-metal.sh script over to machine.  

`vi bare-metal.sh`

`chmod +x bare-metal.sh`

`./bare-metal.sh`

Insert password. 

Watch it work without ever failing like all software of all time always. 

Be great today! 

Could I find better ways to automate this more? Yes, considering I really shouldn't have to run this more than once a year or I really screwed something up it's good for me.
