### Setup Configuration

Used to setup my linux machines with my ideal coding and DevOps software.

Setup machine name to lprior or whatever user is assigned to and update scripts as needed. 

`chmod +x bare-metal.sh`

Insert password. 

Watch it work without ever failing like all software of all time always. 

Be great today!
